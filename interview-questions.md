# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React component is similar to a puzzle piece. It helps the website operate the way that the developer intends for it to operate. There are function and class components.

Researched answer: A React component is a building block that can be recognized as a JavaScript function that returns a React element. There are function components that are simple and concise, and there are class components that can hold state.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: The state values represents the internal data of a component, like the user input. It usually contains the data that will continue to change over time. It is like a variable. Props are similar to arguments that are passed into a component. They cannot be changed within the component.  

Researched answer: Props are can be used to pass data from one component to another; however, they cannot be modified. State values can change; each component has a state.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: programming that revolves around objects & their behavior. 

2. Ruby: open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

3. Implicit return: a way of returning a value in some programming languages without using the return keyword.

4. Ruby blocks: used in Ruby to perform iterative operations on collections such as arrays, hashes, and enumerable objects.

5. Ruby hashes: a collection of key-value pairs. Similar to an array but instead of accessing elements by their index, you access elements by their keys.
